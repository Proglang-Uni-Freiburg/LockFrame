# THESE SCRIPTS ARE OUT OF DATE!
These scripts are pretty much all confirmed to no longer run on the current state of the project.

This is both due to some detectors no longer being present in the existing code base, and due to changes on 
how outputs are handled.

For some simple examples on reader automation, please refer to the example scripts in the parent directory.
